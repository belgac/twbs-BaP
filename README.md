Bootstrap Bits and Pieces is a serie of css/less/sass files adding new modular functionalities to Bootstrap.

It's my first public project, and it's not really "advanced" right now

The aim is to create fully modular bits and pieces you can add to your bootstrap css/sass/less to implement the functionalities you need

The first module is already released in a very early alpha stage it's called spaces and offer you the ability of implementing responsive vertical spacing based on the size of line-height-base, font-size-base, font-size-large and font-size-small
